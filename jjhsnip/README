This contains snippets of PHP code - not really intended for being built into a proper library - but perhaps 
helpful for you. Official I think they are (thanks Google Code Hosting) licensed under MIT license - but I add the 
additional license of public domain.
Feel free to email any questions - but I'm likely not the best person to be asking.

gauth.inc - For authenticating with GData API - returns the Auth token.
googleblogger.inc - For publishing to Google blogger - you will need to pass it an Auth token obtained with gauth.
Example:
$gauth = get_google_login("jjh@42quarks.com", "******", "blogger");
$blogid="124214214214";
$labels="deadfish, deadanimals";
publish_to_blog($head, $content, $labels, $blogid, $gauth, $name="jjh", $email="jjh@42quarks.com");
